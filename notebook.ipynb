I went through half the movie thinking that this was a spoof of the original. Then came that wild and wacky motorcycle scene (notice that this is the only movie that Patricia Birch directs); and I sadly realized they were trying to be serious. I did get a kick out of the fact that the opposing gang, having lost their \"wheels\" due to their gambling habits in the original Grease, were forced to use motorcycles in the second movie. Being shamed by that putz character Carrington, I\\'d hate to see what they would resort to later: maybe Mopeds?<br /><br />I also never bought the hackneyed theme: hunky-Australian-boy-can\\'t-fit-into-Outsiders-dominated-school-ergo-goes-for -tough-guy-with-stupid-biker-helmet-look. It was Disney story gone horribly awry.<br /><br />So, it looks like you CAN ruin a good thing by placing a bubble-gum smacking Michelle Pfeiffer in a musical. The only thing I took away from this movie was an idea of how many points out of ten to give it.'"]},"execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["# Choosing a random review and taking a look at it\n","\n","X_train.iloc[0]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ed5e43c9","metadata":{"id":"ed5e43c9"},"source":["From the above cell output, it could be seen that there are a lot of words that don't add a lot of meaning to the text.
